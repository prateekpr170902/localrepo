🔹 BASIC GIT COMMANDS
git --version

👉 Checks Git is installed or not and shows version.

ls

👉 Shows files and folders in current directory.

pwd

👉 Shows current location (path) in your system.

clear

👉 Clears the terminal screen.

🔹 CONFIGURE GIT (ONE TIME SETUP)
git config --global user.name "My Name"

👉 Sets your name for all Git commits.

git config --global user.email "myemail@gmail.com"

👉 Sets your email for all Git commits.

git config --list

👉 Shows all Git settings (name, email, etc).

echo ~

👉 Shows your home directory path.

cd ~

👉 Takes you to home directory.

🔹 CLONING A REPOSITORY
git clone <repo-link>

👉 Copies a GitHub repository from GitHub to your system.

Example:

git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

🔹 CHECK FILE STATUS
git status

👉 Shows:

which files are changed

which are staged

which are untracked

ls -a

👉 Shows all files including hidden ones (.git folder).
(Used in Git Bash)

ls -Force

👉 Same as above but used in PowerShell.

🔹 FILE STATES IN GIT (VERY IMPORTANT)
State	Meaning
Untracked	New file, Git is not tracking it
Modified	File changed but not staged
Staged	File ready to commit
Unmodified	No changes
🔹 ADDING FILES
git add <file-name>

👉 Adds one file to staging area.

git add .

👉 Adds all changed files to staging area.

🔹 COMMIT
git commit -m "message"

👉 Saves changes with a message.

Example:

git commit -m "Added login page"

🔹 PUSH COMMANDS
git push origin main

👉 Sends your commits from local to GitHub.

🔹 INITIALIZE A NEW REPO
git init

👉 Converts a normal folder into a Git repository.

git remote add origin <repo-link>

👉 Connects your local repo to GitHub repo.

git remote -v

👉 Shows connected remote URLs.

git branch

👉 Shows current branch.

git branch -m main

👉 Renames current branch to main.

git push -u origin main

👉 Pushes code and sets upstream
(-u means future git push works without extra info)

🔹 DIRECTORY COMMANDS
cd ..

👉 Moves one folder back.

mkdir <folder-name>

👉 Creates a new folder.

🔹 COMPLETE FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)

👉 GitHub repo → clone → change code → add → commit → push

This is the daily Git cycle.

🔹 BRANCHING
git branch

👉 Shows all branches.

git branch -M main

👉 Force rename branch to main.

git checkout -b <new-branch>

👉 Creates new branch and switches to it.

git branch -d <branch-name>

👉 Deletes a branch.

🔹 MERGING CODE
git diff <branch-name>

👉 Shows difference between branches.

git merge <branch-name>

👉 Merges given branch into current branch.

🔹 PULL REQUEST (PR)

👉 PR means:

You push code to branch

Create PR on GitHub

Team reviews

Merge into main

🔹 PULL COMMAND
git pull origin main

👉 Brings latest code from GitHub to local.

🔹 RESOLVING MISTAKES / RESET
Case 1: Go one commit back
git reset HEAD~1


👉 Removes last commit but keeps code.

Case 2: Remove last commit completely
git reset --hard HEAD~1


👉 Removes commit and code (dangerous).

Case 3: Reset to specific commit
git reset <commit-hash>


👉 Moves HEAD to that commit.

Force reset (dangerous)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>


👉 Everything after that commit is deleted.

🔥 SUPER SIMPLE SUMMARY

clone → download repo

status → check changes

add → stage changes

commit → save changes

push → upload to GitHub

pull → download latest code

branch → work separately

merge → combine code
